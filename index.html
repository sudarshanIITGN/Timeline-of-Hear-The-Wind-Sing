                <h3>Murakami's novels are a treasure trove of references to get lost into.
                    This is a timeline cataloging every reference to songs, books and movies made by him in his novel <i>Hear the Wind Sing/Pinball</i> for 
                    a smooth nagivation of the story. Refernces are followed by what they are, the page number they appeared in and the corpus of text. I hope
                    this interests atleast one person to read his novels! Books and Authors are in Light Brown. Singers, Composer and Albums are in Sea-green. Movies, Directors and TV shows are in Rose-Violet

                <p><i>"Last year, my girlfriend
                    and
                    I
                    were
                    snuggling
                    together in bed. We were
                    famished.
                    “Is there anything to
                    eat?” I asked her.
                    “Let me check.”
                    She walked naked to the
                    fridge,
                    found
                    some
                    sausage, lettuce, and stale
                    bread, and threw together
                    two sandwiches, which she
                    brought back to bed with
                    two cups of instant coffee.
                    It was a chilly night for
                    October; by the time she
                    slipped back under the
                    covers she was as cold as a
                    can of salmon.
                    “No
                    mustard,
                    I’m
                    afraid.”
                    “Fine by me.”
                    We curled up together
                    and watched an old movie
                    on TV as we munched on
                    the sandwiches.
                    It was The Bridge on the
                    River Kwai."
